          <p>
            PlasmaChain is our Plasma Cash-backed hub for transacting between sidechains and Ethereum mainnet. It allows for highly-scalable, user-facing DApps and secure asset transfers between chains.

            What is staking? 
          </h3>
          <p>
            When a user “stakes” tokens, it means they time-lock their tokens to gain rights, perform services, and access rewards on the network.
            As a LOOM holder, you can <a class="text-primary" href="https://medium.com/loom-network/how-you-can-become-a-plasmachain-delegator-and-help-put-the-d-in-dpos-75177a4bac99?__s=XXXXXXXX">help secure PlasmaChain</a> by staking your tokens with a validator.

          <h3>
            Why is staking important for PlasmaChain?
          </h3>
          <p>
            As PlasmaChain runs a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus model, staking is critical to securing the network. Through “delegation”, users support validators by proxying their tokens with those valdiators’ staking pools. The validator candidates with the largest pools become the official validators of the network. By staking your LOOM tokens, you can help choose the best validators to ensure the strongest possible security and performance for PlasmaChain (and you can earn rewards by doing so — see below). The more people who delegate and actively contribute, the more secure the chain.

            How can I stake my LOOM tokens on PlasmaChain?  
          </h3>
          <p>

            You can stake your tokens from the  PlasmaChain Dashboard:

            <ul>
              <li>Create an account</li>
              <li>Generate a private key</li>
              <li>Log in to your MetaMask wallet</li>
              <li>Deposit LOOM tokens onto PlasmaChain</li>
              <li>Choose validators to stake with</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>
            How many tokens are required to become a delegator?

          <p>
            There is no minimum required amount of tokens to be a delegator.
            Any LOOM token holder can delegate to any validator candidate on the network.

            Which validator(s) should I delegate to?

          <p>
            You can use the <router-link to="/validators" class="router text-primary">PlasmaChain Dashboard</router-link> for a full list of available validator candidates. Keep in mind that validators perform the critical services that maintain the integrity of the system — proposing new blocks, verifying transactions, and participating in governance. In researching the validators that best suit you, you will likely want to evaluate around criteria such as performance (uptime, slashes), reputation, fee % on rewards, community, etc.

            Do I lose control of my tokens when I delegate them to a validator?
          </h3>
          <p>
            No. Upon delegation, your tokens will be sent to a smart contract and essentially frozen on the network for the duration of your lock-up period (which is up to you to select). When the lock-up ends, your tokens are automatically released back to you along with any additional rewards that your validator may have shared with their staking pool.

            Yes. Users can choose to stake their tokens across several validators simultaneously.

          <p>
            Validators earn rewards on any tokens that are delegated to their staking pool. They can choose to share a portion of those rewards back to their delegators —  but this is entirely up to the validator. The percentage each validator shares will be published on the <router-link to="/validators" class="router text-primary">PlasmaChain Dashboard</router-link> to ensure full transparency, so that users can make informed decisions prior to staking.

            For the validators that choose to share rewards on their staking pool, delegators will receive bonus incentives for various lock-up periods. Longer lock-ups are rewarded with higher percentages, as detailed below:

          <p>
            At launch, delegators’ funds will be fully released after 2 weeks. This is a security measure to mitigate against scenarios of staking with a bad candidate to increase their odds of gaining the right to validate, and then immediately un-delegating. This is an area of active research and something we plan to iterate through over the coming months.

          <h3>

          </h3>
          <p>
            Yes. If the protocol rules are not followed, a validator can be ‘slashed’. This means they will forfeit a portion of their staked tokens, including the tokens that have been delegated to their pool. Slashing helps deter malicious behavior and maintain a system whereby everyone is playing by the same rules. It is designed to make dishonest and faulty behavior more costly than it’s worth. For instance, submitting an invalid block, attempting a double spend, and/or experiencing downtime will all lead to slashing. We will be publishing a detailed breakdown of slashing conditions as they are finalized.

          <h3>
            Where do the tokens go when they are slashed? 
          </h3>
          <p>
            Slashed tokens will be contributed back to the remaining token reserve to be paid out as future block rewards for those validating and staking on the network.
